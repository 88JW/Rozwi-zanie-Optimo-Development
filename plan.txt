Bedroom renovation plan:

The first step for two people:
-Choose paint colour
-Don't argue
-Go and buy a container with paint in the right size
-Go back and buy another tin of paint because the first calculations (nobody knows why) were wrong.

The second step for two people:
-Get everything out of the room by yourself
-Find out that it could have been covered with foil
-Get everything back in and cover it all with foil

The third step for two people:
-Find paining tolls
-Go and buy a new painting roll because the old one looks like a piece of rock. 
-Buy more painter's tape just in case and argue about it.

The fourth step for two people:
-Tape everything over with your partner
-Start painting first layer of the wall but not the ceiling
-A few hours later, you can start painting the second layer of paint
-Finally find out that the colours do not match
-Go to first step and repeat all
